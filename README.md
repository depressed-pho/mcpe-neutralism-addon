# Neutralism
An MCPE behavior pack which makes hostile mobs always spawn in neutral.
Unless you aggravate them:
* Blazes don't shoot fireballs at you.
* Creepers don't explode.
* Spiders or Cave Spiders don't attack you.

## Tested on
* MCPE v0.16.0


## How to build
1. Install the following tools:
 * GNU Autoconf
 * GNU Automake
 * GNU Make
 * [yamljs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yamljs)
 * Info-Zip [Zip](http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html)
2. Run `./Build`.
3. Now there should be `mcpe-neutralism-addon-*.mcpack` under `_build/src/`.
